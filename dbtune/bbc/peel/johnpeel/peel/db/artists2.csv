4,"...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead","andyoullknowusby.jpg","This US four piece are best known for their chaotic yet melodic music and anarchic stage shows, which frequently end with the band trashing their equipment. Their rather macabre name is taken from a Mayan ritual chant, rather than a penchant for serial killing, which must be a relief to their record company.<BR/>Founder members Jason Reece and Conrad Keely, who between them sing and play drums and guitar, first met in Hawaii. They moved to the college town of Olympia, Washington in 1993, to take advantage of the town's thriving music scene. Both joined various bands, but tired of the north west and moved to Austin, Texas, home of the South by South West festival, and started playing as a duo under the name You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead. Bass player Neil Busch and guitarist Kevin Allen joined soon after and the band name expanded to include ... And. In 1998 they put out a cassette of a live show on local indie Golden Hour Records, which was followed by a self-titled album on Trance Syndicate. ... Trail of Dead moved to Merge records to release 2001's 'Madonna'. They were picked up by Interscope and put out the albums 'Source Tags and Codes' (2002) and 'World's Apart' (2005) to much critical acclaim.<BR/>Despite their major label funding the band remain true to their roots and are happy for fans to tape their shows as long as they receive a copy of the recording.<BR/><blockquote>\"...Trail of Dead was great because they were thrilled to be there and so impressed at everything we said - 'Wow, you worked with that guy?' or 'I didn't know so-and-so had played here!'.<BR/>They kept the excitement up during the gig by playing pre-recorded fillers in-between songs, and the audience loved it.\"</blockquote>"

They were one of several Welsh bands who, following the success of Manic Street Preachers, began to clamour for their own space in the music press and record shops of Britain. Whilst never as popular as their contemporaries such as Stereophonics and The Super Furry Animals, the Dolls had a devoted, and T-shirted, fanbase.The band formed in the mostly working class city of Newport in Wales. Richard Parfitt (vocals/ guitar) and Mike Cole (bass) met whilst signing on and discovered a shared interest in Motown and classic British rock bands such as The Jam, The Clash and The Who. Six months later, in 1993, they were joined by drummer Carl Bevan.<BR/>Having built up a reputation for rowdy and energetic performances around Wales, they were signed to Indolent Records and released their first single 'Happy Shopper' in 1994. Singles 'Pig Valentine' and Stay' followed and in 1995 they joined the NME Brat Bus tour alongside Veruca Salt and Marion. Album 'The Big Three' was released in 1996 and its follow-up 'Joya Magica' appeared in 1998. The band split in 1999 after being dropped by Indolent."

They signed to Glasgow indie Chemikal Underground and bought in string players Jenny Reeve (violin) and Stacey Sievewright (cello).<BR/>Arab Strap's first album 'The Week Never Starts Round Here' was released in 1996 and followed by 'Philophobia' in 1998 and 'Elephant Shoe' (2000), The Red Thread (2001) and Monday at the Hug and Pint (2003). Fellow Scottish band Belle and Sebastian paid tribute to Arab Strap, naming their 1998 album The Boy With The Arab Strap. (If you're wondering, an Arab Strap is made of leather, with a metal ring and is often used to help maintain an erection. You can learn all sorts here.)"

They changed their name to Ash in 1992 when they joined up with Rick McMurray (drums), who was in the school year ahead of them. <BR/>By 1994 they had signed to Infectious in the UK and Reprise in the US and released their debut mini-album 'Trailer' to critical praise.The following year, with Britpop at its height, Ash scored a Top 20 hit with 'Girl From Mars'. Their album '1977' (named for the year Tim and Mark were born) topped the UK charts in 1996.<BR/>Guitarist Charlotte Hatherley joined in 1997, but despite her status as an indie pin-up and production from Garbage's Butch Vig, album 'Nu-clear Sounds' didn't fare well. Undaunted Ash returned two years later with 'Free All Angels', which went to number one, with single 'This Shining Light' gaining a nomination at the Ivor Novello Awards.'Clones' taken from 2004's 'Meltdown' was used in the Star Wars computer game 'Republic Commando', the first piece of music to be used in the Star Wars series which had not been written by composer John Williams."

Since then the duo have released several albums, the most recent being 2005's 'Untitled', and several remixes for artists including Skinny Puppy, DJ Food and Tortoise. <BR/>Brown and Booth are extremely reclusive, although they have an extremely devoted fanbase. They state that the name Autechre can be pronounced in any fashion and have also recorded under the names Lego Feet and Velocity Kendall. <BR/>Aphex Twin once claimed to be the brains behind Autechre, but, as he also claimed to be behind Plone and Boards of Canada at the same time, you can take that with a pinch of salt."

204,"Billy Bragg","billy_bragg.jpg","Billy specialised in combining the uncombinable: punk and folk, sarcasm and warmth, politics and love. Billy's lyrics are sometimes cutting and angry, sometimes warm, but always insightful and witty. His songs paint a picture of Britain in the 1980s and capture the disillusionment that many felt at the time. <BR/> He was born in Barking, London as Stephen William Bragg and started playing guitar in his teens with his next-door neighbour Wiggy. The two of them formed a punk band called Riff Raff, but success was not forthcoming.<BR/>Surprisingly, Billy then joined the army. Unsurprisingly he hated it and bought his way out with £175 and returned to his parents' home. <BR/> Billy devised ingenious strategies to get his demo tapes heard. He pretended to be a television repair man in order to get into the office of Peter Jenner at Charisma Records. When Billy heard our own John Peel announce he was hungry on air, he rushed to the BBC studios with a mushroom biriyani and a tape. He was rewarded with lots of airplay, which John always insisted he would have got anyway. <BR/> In 1985, the year after he released 'Brewing Up With Billy Bragg', he helped to form the left-wing youth movement Red Wedge, whose members also included Paul Weller and Jimmy Sommerville. 1984 also saw one of Billy's songs, 'New England' become a Top 10 hit, albeit sung by Kirsty MacColl. Album after album followed, but it was 1991's 'Don't Try This At Home' which featured his biggest hit, 'Sexuality'. Billy took several years off to concentrate on fatherhood and his most recent album is 2002's 'England, Half English'. Wiggy still plays in his backing band. <BR/><blockquote>\"I was coming back from a gig somewhere and my girlfriend met me at the station and told me that the BBC phoned wanting me to do a Peel session. So I thought this was it - I'm a made man! I'm in! I rang my record company and said 'How am I going to get there? I don't even know where Maida Vale is. How am I going to get all my stuff on the tube?' And they said 'Bill, they pay you to do this, get a bloody taxi', which I thought was too good to be true; they PAY you to do a Peel session!\"</blockquote><BR/>Billy Bragg"

But Bis were fun, Bis had energy. Amanda MacKinnon and brothers John and Steve Clark, to use the names their mothers gave them, had been friends since childhood. They managed two singles 'Transmissions On A Teen-C Tip' and 'The Secret Vampire Soundtrack' without a proper record deal and in 1996 became the first unsigned band to appear on Top Of The Pops. The media went Bis mad and the group signed to Wiija in the UK and the Beastie Boys' Grand Royal in the States. Three albums followed and in 2001 they began composing music for a Power Puff Girls video game. Sadly in 2003 Bis said goodbye to their plastic fantastic world of New Wave pop and split up."

But Damon Albarn (vocals), Graham Coxon (guitar), Alex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree (drums) have been through many musical changes, from the shoegazing-lite of Leisure (1991) to the rollicking Mockney guitar pop of Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993) and Parklife (1994) and their later forays into American-influenced lo-fi rock ('13', 1999).The group started out as an outfit called Seymour, changing their name after signing to Food Records. After becoming perhaps the most successful band of the Britpop era, Blur began to crack up. Damon split from his long-term girlfriend, Elastica singer Justine Frischman, Dave stopped drinking and gained a pilot's licence, Alex holed up in various London bars with new friends Damien Hirst and Keith Allen, and Graham, sickened by it all, left the group. Blur continued as a three piece. Now their future is uncertain. Damon has said he no longer wants to record without Graham, but his former guitarist has, so far, remained silent.<BR/><blockquote>\"I don't know why, but John got this thing in his mind that he wanted to invite artists round to his house to do sessions, rather than at Maida Vale all the time. He invited a handful of bands over the years, and they would come complete with full P.A. system, a truck, all their gear and everything else that goes with it. Anyway, Blur was the first ever one. <BR/>\"They were a massive band already, and very famous. But the wonderful thing about them was that they were so chuffed to be there, like little kids. Every time John came within five feet of them Damon would go bright red.\"</blockquote> <BR/>- Miti Adhikari"

As reggae's best known artist, his music is responsible for spreading the messages of the Rastafarian faith and stories of the Jamaican people. <BR/>Born Robert Nesta Marley in Jamaica in1945, Bob moved to the island's capital Kingston at the age of 14 to become a pupil of local singer Joe Higgs. He went on to form a group called The Teenagers, who later changed their name to The Wailing Rude Boys, later The Wailers. This version of the group disbanded in 1966, but later reformed with Marley (lead vocals), Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston. This line up released 'Catch A Fire' (1973) and 'Burnin' (1974), before Tosh and Livingston left to pursue solo careers. Marley then started working with the I-Threes, consisting of his wife Rita, Marcia Griffith and Judy Mowatt. Together they produced 1975's 'Natty Dread' which contained the worldwide hit 'No Woman No Cry.' <BR/>An assassination attempt in 1976 meant he was forced to leave Jamaica and settle in America. The album 'Exodus', considered a classic, was released in 1977. But in 1980 Marley collapsed whilst jogging in new York's Central Park. He was found to have cancer, which had spread through his lungs, liver and brain. He died on May 11, 1981, aged just 36. <BR/><blockquote>\"When Marley arrived at the studio, you realised he was a star; very quiet and somehow dignified. Of course, all of them were there then, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh. <BR/>\"I seem to remember it took a lot of time to get it started, there was a lot of sitting around, as you'd expect, and, at that time, of course, possessing marijuana was an imprisonable offence; they did everything very discreetly, but you could smell it, even through the double doors, in the control room. They were also grinding hash up and putting it in honey. What was I supposed to do? BBC training would probably have told me to call the police. <BR/>\"Anyway, that was on their first visit to Britain, years before they were noticed. Only Island and us were on to them then.\" </blockquote><BR/>- John Walters (In Session Tonight by Ken Garner)"

His most surprising recording was probably 2004's 'Bonnie 'Prince' Billy Sings Greatest Palace Music' where he teamed up with a polished group of Nashville session musicians to rerecord much of his back catalogue. <BR/>Little known fact: Will Oldham was an actor and appeared in several TV movies before becoming a musician."
258,"Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band","","The urban spacemen of the late-60's, the Bonzo Dog Doo-DahBand (as they were called at the time of this Peel Session) went through several name changes, starting as the Bonzo Dog Dada Band and ending, simply, as the Bonzo Dog Band. The group combined comedy and music in a psychedelic cabaret, even appearing in The Beatles 'Magical Mystery Tour'. Paul McCartney, using the name Apollo C. Vermouth, even produced their single 'I'm The Urban Spaceman' which hit the Top 5 in 1968. Band stalwart Neil Innes went on to work with the Monty Python team, writing the music for their spoof documentary The Ruttles."

Their most recent albums were 2003's  'Ha Ha Sound', followed by 'Tender Buttons' this year (2005).<BR/> <blockquote>\"There was a sense of initiation on entering the Maida Vale studios. We were quiet as we received our BBC badges and escorted, by security, to the large elevators that took us and our equipment down below ground-level. What we found was a maze of hallways and side rooms, strangely silent and uninhabited. During a break from recording, we wondered through the corridors, peering through the windows of locked rooms, on a hunt for the Radiophonic Workshop. We came across abandoned tape machines and Shostakovich posters in the hallways and scratched our heads curiously at finding a rare EMS Vocoder sitting all lonely in the corner of a deserted foyer. It was wonderful to be free to walk around unquestioned. <BR/>\"We hovered outside the locked Radiophonic room, a little disappointed by what we could see through the window - a couple of DX7s and stacked cardboard boxes. We contemplated unscrewing the Radiophonic Workshop name plate from the door and making off with it, but knew the stern-faced security guard from earlier would have been on to us.\" </blockquote><BR/>- Trish Keenan, Broadcast"

Whilst opening for Liz Phair she met Sonic Youth's Steve Shelley who encouraged her to record her music. Her first two albums were taped in one day. 'Dear Sir' was released in 1995 and 'Myra Lee' appeared the year after.In 1996 she signed to Matador Records and produced 'What Would The Community Think' (1996) and 'Moon Pix' (1998). Tiring of her own material, she turned to The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Smog and others for 'The Covers Album' (2000). Chan went back to original material in 2003 with 'You Are Free', supposedly influenced by the film 'Good Will Hunting'. <BR/>Cat Power live shows are famous for their lack of direction and Chan is an unpredictable performer.

But producers Jonathan More and Matt Black shouldn't be dismissed as a pair of knob-twiddling hipsters: they've always had an agenda. Coldcut's cut-and-paste style is more than fancy DJ-ing: the two believe that the world can be explored through play. <BR/>More and Black first proper release was 1987's 'Hey Kids, What Time Is It?' Only 5000 copies were made and the records were sold as US imports under the name DJ Coldcut to avoid having to pay for sample credits. In 1991 they set up their record label Ninja Tune, which became a by-word for breaks-based cool throughout the decade. Their celebrated addition to the Journey's By DJ series came out in 1995, followed by 'Let Us Play' in 1997.<BR/> <blockquote>\"About 25 years ago when I was at college, I was in a band called the Jazz Insects, and we sent a copy of our first single to John. Now, we'd heard it was possible to speak to John on the phone if you called Radio 1, and after a few unsuccessful tries we actually managed to speak to him. He had a very cool manner, and I dried up immediately, but he did play our record that night and we received a helpful £50 royalty cheque. Little did I know that years later I'd be doing a session on the same show.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Matt Black, Coldcut"

They had, after all, spent years in relative obscurity, with only the occasional stunt getting them any kind of attention. Tjinder Singh (vocals, guitar), Ben Ayer (guitar), Avtar Singh, Tjinder's brother (bass) and David Chambers (drums) came out of Leicester, with a mix of Asian music, shambolic punk and fiercely held anti-racist views. During Morrissey's somewhat suspect flirtation with mod and skinhead imagery Cornershop burned pictures of the singer at gigs and outside the offices of his record label. <BR/>In 1994 sitar player Anthony Saffery joined, as did guitarist Wallis Healey. Avtar and David left, replaced with drummer Nick Simms and percussionist Pete Hall. They began picking up well-known fans, most notably Brian Eno and David Byrne. Their 1995 album 'Woman's Gotta Have It' was released on Byrne's Luaka Bop label. <BR/>The real breakthrough came with 1997's 'When I Was Born For The Seventh Time', which featured the smash 'Brimful Of Asha' and a collaboration with Beat poet Allen Ginsberg. Somewhat frightened by success, Cornershop took a break, returning in 2002 with 'Handcream for A Generation'. "

John played it so much that The Boys got a single deal with Rough Trade and hit the top of the Festive Fifty. Their follow-up 'Cognoscenti vs Intelligentsia' became better known as 'Hamster Dance' thanks to an on-line animation set to the music. It reached No.4 in the UK charts in 1999. Following John's death the group made a single 'The Nation Needs You' which combined samples of John speaking with Peel favourite Status Quo's 'Down Down'.

Or so it seemed in the UK in 2001, but The Datsuns has been heavy rocking in their home country since 1997. The Datsuns all took the name of the band as a last name, but whether they wanted to be a Ramones-esque band of brothers, or just to avoid the taxman is unclear. Nonetheless the slinky-hipped vocalist Dolph Datsun and his cohorts took Britain by storm, with support from John Peel and huge amounts of hype from the UK press. They started their tour sleeping on sofas and ended it with various record companies fighting to foot their hotel bills. The Datsuns signed to V2 in 2002 and released their self-titled debut album. They followed it with 'Outta Sight, Outta Mind' in 2004. <BR/><blockquote>\"They were just incredible. They were all over the place - playing upstairs, hanging off the balcony, jumping on top of speakers, jumping on top of the Hammond organ we'd set up. Plenty of guitar solos with their heads right back, the works. And it didn't matter that it was for a session. There's not many bands that put that much effort into a performance. Afterwards they were collapsed on the floor, completely knackered, because everything was focused on that hour performance, like how a footballer trains all week for those 90 minutes on the pitch on Saturday. Absolutely stunning.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Simon Askew"
489,"Dave Angel","","Dave got into techno in the late 80s, fascinated by new sounds and new technology. 'I was thinking 'This is the music of the youth and 20 years from now it's going to be like the rock of the 60s'. I had to get in on it.' <BR/>Although raised in a musical family (his dad was a modern jazz musician), Dave didn't 'get on it' until after the death of his father and series of jail sentences. He was swept along by acid house and in 1989 released a re-work of The Eurhythmics' 'Sweet Dreams', called the 'Nightmare Mix', which reached No. 23 in the UK charts. Popular in techno circles as a producer and a DJ, Dave became massive in Germany's tech-heavy club scene. In 1996 he released his debut album 'Tales Of The Unexpected', followed by 1997's 'Globetrotting'."
490,"Dave Clarke","DaveClarke.jpg","Stalking through pulsing clubs, often dressed in black, sometimes wearing eyeliner, Dave Clarke is a DJ who should be a rock star. His influences range from hip hop to goth and he has produced and DJ-ed in a variety of dance genres, with his fancy currently settling on techno with a heavy electro twist. <BR/>As a teenager Dave discovered his father's extensive range of stereo equipment and lights and took them off to the attic, the walls of which he'd coated with silver foil. <BR/>Despite the attractions of his rather odd lair, Dave ran away from home at the age of 16 and spent several years DJ-ing at small nights and working in go-nowhere jobs. <BR/>By the early 90s Dave has a record deal. In 1996 he released 'Archive No.1' which was critically praised for breaking away from the straightjacket of techno purism. Even after many years of the music business, Dave hasn't lost his enthusiasm: 'I have an unbridled passion for this,' he says. 'I suppose I've never grown up. I hope so.' <BR/>'He's quite a techie person, so we'd spend a while chatting about the equipment in the studio. Then the next time we'd see him he'd say that he'd bought all the stuff he'd been talking about before. <BR/>He is also part of the sessions family because he's done so many and John really loved him. When we did John's tribute night Dave was one of the first people to come forward to perform, and he ended up playing a beautiful set, mixing Teenage Kicks into techno. After the show he put up a message on his website explaining the reasons behind why he played the songs he did, as they were all dedicated to John. <BR/>- Andy Rogers"
491,"David Bowie","davidbowie.jpg","Where to start? Bowie is one of the artists John Peel is credited with discovering and his career has spanned many years, sounds and changes in style. He has been David Jones, Ziggy Stardust, The Thin White Duke and The Man Who Fell To Earth. <BR/>He started out in south London, changing his last name from Jones to Bowie when The Monkees' Davy Jones became a star. He released a few unsuccessful mod-style singles, before recreating himself as a singer/songwriter for his first album 'Man Of Words, Man Of Music'. He followed this with the rockier 'The Man Who Sold The World' and the avant-pop of 'Hunky Dory'. <BR/>But Bowie's global breakthrough came when he unveiled Ziggy Stardust, his bisexual glam-alien character. The albums 'Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars' and 'Aladdin Sane' followed. After retiring Ziggy, Bowie began to move in a direction he called plastic soul for 'Young Americans' and 'Station To Station'. However his heavy cocaine usage was starting to take its toll. He moved to Berlin in an effort to clean up and started to collaborate with Brian Eno, producing 1977's 'Low', following it up with the classic 'Heroes'. Later albums were less well received. Although David Bowie remains an interesting an experimental artist, his career in recent years has lost a little of the sheen that made him such a glorious spectacle at his peak."

617,"Elastica","","Two minutes of sparse, angular, catchy punk pop: Elastica's first single, 'Stutter', had such an impact that John Peel chose it as one of the seminal singles of 1993. Elastica were formed by Justine Frischmann (vocals, guitar) in 1991 after leaving Suede, recruiting Justin Welch (drums), Annie Holland (bass) and Donna Matthews (guitar). Elastica's fame grew throughout 1994 (helped along by tabloid interest in Frischmann's relationship with Blur's Damon Albarn), and their eponymous debut LP reached #1 in 1995. With three singles ('Line Up', 'Connection' and 'Waking Up') making it into the Top 20, 'Elastica' was seen as a defining record of the Britpop era - perhaps too much so, since they seemed incapable of recording a follow-up. Rumoured heroin abuse and good old 'personal difficulties' dogged the band for the next few years before the release of a six track EP and an album 'The Menace' in 1999. Sales were disappointing and, shortly after, Elastica disbanded."

Their first album 'Pretty-Slow' (1996) was followed by 'Pardon My French' (1997), 'Conduct' (1998), 'Cupid's Cactus' (2001) and 'These Are Not My Bongos' (2003), after which the band split into solo projects."

His electronic, experimental compositions ushered in the synthpop era. After a series of demos for Beggars Banquet in 1978, he released his first album, 'Tubeway Army', later the same year. This was followed by '79's 'Replicas', which included the smash hit single 'Are Friends Electric?', an influential Peel Session, and, later that same year, 'The Pleasure Principle', which spawned 'Cars'. 'Cars' sealed Numan's fame both here and in the US, backed up by elaborate, futuristic stage shows. More albums followed - 'Telekon' (1980), 'The Dance' (1981), 'I, Assasain' (1982), 'Warriors' (1983) - but sales were declining, and 'Warriors' was to spawn his last top ten hit. "

Combining the cheek of Britpop with the rawness of predecessors like The Faces and the Jam, Gene featured Martin Rossiter on vocals and guitar, plus Matt James (drums) and Kevin Miles on bass. In 1994, they signed to Polydor and released another single, 'Be My Light, Be My Guide' in 1994. Spurred on by Martin Rossiter's witty and sometimes outrageous interviews, by January 1995 the band had been named 'Best New Act' at NME's Brat Awards. Their debut album 'Olympian' reached the Top 10 in 1995. It was followed by a collection of b-sides and Peel sessions in 1996, and another album, 'Drawn to the Deep End', in 1997. Despite reaching the Top 10, 'Drawn Into the Deep End' received mixed reviews, and by 2000, the band found themselves without a record deal. Undaunted by this, they founded their own label, 'Contral', and issued the live set 'Rising for Sunset - Live at the Troubadour' in 2000, followed by 2002's 'Libertine'."

Ex-student, recording artist, producer (and later, convicted paedophile) Jonathan King produced the group, and renamed them Genesis. Their first album, 'From Genesis to Revelation', was released in 1969. Former child actor Phil Collins joined as drummer in 1970. 1972's 'Foxtrot' was a high point in the band's history, and their live performances incorporating masks, makeup and props, became major multimedia events. In 1975 Phil Collins took over as lead singer, and the band's success continued, with 1981's 'Abacab' proving to be a big hit, its success only beaten by 1985's 'Invisible Touch'. During the late 60s and early 70s Peel championed Genesis, but he grew disillusioned with their later excesses. 'I used to go and see Genesis', remarked Peel, 'and after about three minutes I'd think, oh, I wish this would stop!'"

A combination of jangly pop and spiky new wave, Guided by Voices's pop songs earned them a small but loyal following in the American indie scene. Prior to 1993's 'Vampire on Titus', the band seemed headed for relative obscurity. But this album received wider distribution that its predecessors, and the band acquired several celebrity fans, including Kim Deal and Thurston Moore. A deal with Matador followed, and their next album, 'Bee Thousand' (1994) became a word-of-mouth hit, resulting in Lolopolooza dates and MTV airplay. Barring a brief hiatus to TVT records, Guided by Voices continued on Matator until 2004, when Pollard announced that he was breaking up the band."

'Back In The D.H.S.S' went on to become the biggest-selling independent album of that year. On the cusp of super-stardom Nigel and Si Blackwell, Neil Crossley and Paul Wright split-up, disillusioned with the constant attentions of the media, who all probably wanted to know just what their name actually meant. They re-formed to the relief of fans of wryness and sarcasm in 1990, proceeding to release a further string of highly acclaimed albums, though it'll always be their mid-80s heyday forever associated with the great man Peel.

The band's music fused indie pop with acid house, techno and northern soul, spawning Britain's burgeoning, E-drenched 'Madchester' scene. The Mondays disbanded in 1992, and Shaun Ryder and Bez formed Black Grape. Subsequent Mondays reunions, (in 1999 and 2004) have thus far proven to be unsuccessful."

Formerly of Madchester japesters The Soup Dragons, by the mid-90s, vocalist and lead guitarist Sean Dickson wanted to move on. He founded The High Fidelity, featuring Ross McFarlane (drums) and Adrian Barry (bass) in 1995 for a compilation released by High Times magazine. The band's debut EP, 'Stash', was released in 1996, with their first full-length LP, 'Demonstration', coming out in 2002. Always experimental, the band's second Peel session featured four songs written and recorded on the instrument, while they performed 'Silent Night' on one for his Christmas Carol show. These proved extremely popular, and led the band to give Peel an Omnichord for his 60th birthday. Peel later wrote a song for the band's Omnichord only album, the inventively titled 'Omnichord Album'. "

870,"Hole","","Conspiracy theorists will forever have a field day with the fact that Hole's clinically aggressive second album, 1994's 'Live Through This', was released just four days after Kurt Cobain killed himself, the band's frontwoman Courtney Love having given a tearful eulogy to her dead husband in Seattle. If anything, it was an eerily poignant testament to pain and inner strength, something that was further tested when two months later Hole's bassist Kristen Pffaf died of a drug overdose. Tragedy, scandal and provocation continually followed the Californian grungers with a revolving-door membership. One last album was to come, the glossy alternative-pop of 1998's 'Celebrity Skin', before Hole disbanded. Courtney Love didn't then release another note of music till her solo debut, 2004's 'America's Sweetheart'."

Jawbone records his tracks in his basement on extremely lo-fi equipment, and, despite the lack of band members, manages to create sweaty, foot-tappin', bawlin' and hollerin', balls-to-the-wall rock and roll blues so noisy that it makes your ears hurt. His self-released album, Dang Blues, came out in 2003. <BR/><blockquote>\"We've obviously had plenty of solo artists in and out of Maida Vale in the past, and they usually bring a guitar with them, or a piano or whatever. But Jawbone is essentially a one-man band, complete with guitar, harmonica, kick drum and snare. One man playing a bunch of instruments all at the same time, on his own. We recorded it as live - I set up mics all around him, and he brought his own harmonica mic with him, called a Green Bullet. He was great, and a thoroughly nice bloke.\"</blockquote>"

Mills' music fuses acid and industrial techno with the typically sparse hardcore of Detroit. His releases include two full-length volumes of 'Waveform Transmissions' (Tresor), a live album and rarities collection for the British label React, and the first album in a new contract with Sony Japan, as well as a handful of 12-inch EPs on Axis and several collaborations with Robert Hood on his M-Plant label.

Hendrix's groundbreaking approach to playing and his unorthodox left-handed guitar technique made him into a lasting musical icon. He died young: he was 27 when he suffocated after ingesting wine and sleeping pills in 1970. Countless posthumous recordings have surfaced since, including his Peel Sessions."

The latter was sadly released a few months after Ian Curtis killed himself on May 18th 1980.

She started singing while at college, and ended up befriending John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants, with whom she sings on the band's 1992 release Apollo 18. <BR/> In fact, BBC producer Andy Rogers said of her first session with Peel: \"at the time she was still working - quite bizarrely in banking or personnel or something - in a big city corporation in New York. John heard her album and played it into the ground.\" <BR/> Her debut album in 2000, Not the Tremblin' Kind, caught the attention of Peel, and in the end she recorded five sessions for the man - 3 at Peel Acres and 2 at Maida Vale. <BR/> She has since released 2 LPs, the last of which Humming by the Flowering Vine (2005) is dedicated to Peel's memory."

The group recorded their entire first album in just under 30 hours and only two months after its release it hit the US Top Ten. The band toured extensively and gained a fearsome reputation for their live performances and their off-stage antics. Their bluesy, instinctive brand of soulful rock 'n' roll music won them legions of fans all over the world: Led Zeppelin IV sold over 16 million copies in the following years.

Wainwright became a singer/songwriter in the late 60s, singing honest, funny folk songs. Releases include the imaginatively-titled 'Album I' (1970), 'Album II' (1971) and 'Album III' (1972). Immensely prolific, Wainwright has churned out over 20 albums so far, not to mention a son and a daughter, Rufus and Martha, both of whom have gone on to trouble the UK chart with their own respective takes on the singer-songwriter genre.<BR/><blockquote>\"On one particular day at Peel Acres, Louden came up, and we managed to soundcheck in about two seconds - it was just one microphone and a guitar. So whilst we were waiting for John to arrive, we all took a dip in John's pool.<BR/>\"When stuff like that happens, it really calms the artist and by the time they're ready to perform they are completely relaxed, which, more often than not, comes through on the session.\"</blockquote>"

They have recorded critically acclaimed albums such as 'Secret Name' (1999) and 'Things We Lost in the Fire' (2001) before moving to Rough Trade for their last long player, 'The Great Destroyer' (2004). Low have recorded several Peel Sessions, including a live set broadcast from the 2002 All Tomorrow's Parties festival.<BR/><blockquote>\"We had what we call a 'Mogwai Moment' during Low's live session, which basically means that when the music is so tender, fractured and quiet, the emergency DAT kicks in because the computers up at Broadcasting House think that there is dead air going out. I then had to rush out half way through a song, because the band didn't know what was happening on air, and politely ask them to stop. In front of the band, the audience, and John, this was quite embarrassing. That session was amazing, I still play the CD now.\"</blockquote>"

They were a real Peel favourite, representing Radio 1 at the Eurosonic Festival in Europe as his special guests and heading up the Festive Fifty in 2001 with their single 'Chinese Whispers', (beating bands such as The Strokes, White Stripes, Pulp and New Order to the top spot). The band's latest album, 'Life's Too Short', came out in 2005. They also appeared at Radio One's 'Keeping It Peel' tribute show. So far the band have played eleven Peel sessions in the years between 1997-2002. The final session was a birthday treat for Peel - he was expecting to play a repeat session and was pleasantly surprised when the band turned up at Peel acres with all their live equipment, ready to rock.

After Duxie's tragic death in a swimming accident, the band left Nicky Thomas in 1978 and released a debut album, 'Live at the Counter Eurovision'. The band spent time in Zambia and West Africa and their music became increasingly African, rather than Jamaican, in its influence. Throughout it all John Peel supported the band, giving them heavy airplay on his show. On their website Misty in Roots paid homage to Peel, celebrating '25 years of memories and support.

In 1998 they released a remix collection called 'Kicking a Dead Pig', followed by the 'No Education No Future (F**k the Curfew)' EP. 1999 saw the release of 'Come On Die Young', then 'Rock Action' and the 'My Father My Kind' EP in 2001.

This last was introduced by John Peel himself, but sadly he died before it was released."

1311,"My Bloody Valentine","","'John Peel was our universe', said Kevin Shields - so much so that Shields stood outside the BBC one day in 1985 for four hours, waiting for Peelie to come out. From that first single on, Shields and his band My Bloody Valentine were to redefine what noise meant. 1988's 'Isn't Anything' (Creation) blends shimmering distortion and ghostly melodies with sheets of bendy white noise, spawning the term 'shoegazing' (later applied to whole scene) due to the band's refusal to look at their audience during their live shows. In 1991 the band released 'Loveless' (Creation), which was hailed as a masterpiece (and reportedly cost a whopping £500,000 to make, crippling Creation until they signed Oasis in 1994). And then _ nothing. Shields now spends his time producing other artists, and in 2003 broke silence to record the original soundtrack to the hit movie, 'Lost in Translation'."

1315,"Napalm Death","napalm_death.jpg","Napalm Death are one of the more extreme bands supported by John Peel, and illustrate the unprecedented diversity of his taste. Formed in Ipswich in 1982, Napalm Death were early exponents of the 'grindcore' genre, pushing the boundaries of heavy metal by warping traditional song structures to produce short, sharp bursts of ear-splitting noise and ferocious screaming.  John Peel was an ardent supporter of the band, and repeatedly played the 4-second track 'You Suffer' on his show. Napalm Death recorded a now-legendary Peel Session in September of 1987. These recordings were later released by Strange Fruit Records in 1989 and re-released as part of Napalm Death's 'Complete BBC Sessions' album in July 2000.<BR/><blockquote>\"There was a period in about 1988 when we had thrash band, after thrash band, after thrash band coming in to do Maida Vale sessions. These bands played pretty hard, full-on music, and they'd been in a tour van for the last two weeks, and you'd walk into their studio and you'd know they'd been working hard, if you know what I mean. Napalm Death was an extraordinary session because the songs were so short. When a song only lasts two seconds you can hardly say to the band, 'Can you play that again please, I think a guitar was out of tune.\"</blockquote>"

She has since produced two more studio albums (2000's Furnace Room Lullaby and 2002's Blacklisted), and has toured with Nick Cave and recorded with indie-rock supergroup The New Pornographers. In 2000, Neko Case & Her Boyfriends did a week-long tour of the UK, a highlight of which was their Peel session.

By this time the band had split and Nick Cave had formed another band, Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, with ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, drummer Mick Harvey, and Einsturzende Neubauten guitarist Blixa Bargeld. This band stayed together for over a decade and produced many great albums such as 'Tender Prey' (1988), 'Let Love In' (1994), 'Murder Ballads' (1996) and more recent offerings such as 'No More Shall We Part' (2001) and ''Nocturama' (2003).

By the time Peel had started playing its haunting, intimate compositions in heavy rotation on his show (he'd been sent a copy by Steve Albini, Nastasia's engineer), 'Dogs' was already out of print. It was followed by 'Blackened Air' (2002) and 'Run to Ruin' (2003), both on Touch and Go, who also re-released 'Dogs' in 2004. Accompanied by her band (instruments played include cello, bowed saw and voila), Nastasia creates ghostly, subdued music, with a nod towards country and American folk. Nastasia played four sessions at the BBC studios, and twice at Peel Acres.<BR/><blockquote>\"The last thing we did with Nina was at Peel Acres, and on this occasion Nina brought a couple of Tuvan throat singers with her to perform on the session. John thought this was a good time to do his fox impression live on air (which, if you knew John, was something he loved to do at any given moment) to try to impress the Tuvan singers, presumably because he thought they sounded like a fox.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Andy Rogers"
1351,"Nirvana","nirvana.jpg","It's unlikely anyone could have predicted the meteoric rise of Nirvana from their humble 1985 beginnings in Aberdeen, WA, a small logging town 10 miles out of Seattle. They recorded their debut album 'Bleach' (1989) on a budget of only $600, leading to a contract with DGC, where they recorded their seminal  'Nevermind' album. By the beginning of 1992, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' had hit the Top Ten on both sides of the Atlantic and 'Nevermind' had toppled Michael Jackson's 'Dangerous' from the top of the US album chart. However, cracks started to appear at the peak of the band's success. Shortly after the release of the final Nirvana album, 'In Utero', the band's troubled frontman Kurt Cobain went through a series of heroin overdoses, and eventually committed suicide on April 4th 2004. John Peel spotted Nirvana early - the band recorded three Peel Sessions in 1989, 1990 and 1991. <BR/><blockquote>\"Nirvana did a few sessions at Maida Vale. I think I did their last one, which was still relatively early in their career. Jeff Smith phoned me and said 'you've got a really hot one this week - Nirvana', and to be honest I hadn't really heard of them. The session went well, and I thought they were good. We recorded it, went to the pub for a couple of drinks, then came back to mix it. It was only when their manager, John Silva, came in to the studio and told them that they'd just gone double-platinum in America (with 'Nevermind') that I thought, 'hmm, they must be quite famous then'.<BR/>\"I remember that Kurt didn't react much when his manager told him their album was number one in the States. He seemed to be more bothered about that fact that Fender had delivered six white, left-handed Stratocaster guitars to his hotel room. They must've liked the session though, because they later insisted that I do the live recording at Reading. The Foo Fighters have used me ever since, too.\"</blockquote><BR/>John Peel"

From the kaleidoscopic genre-pushing of 1994's 'Snivilisation' to 1999's brutally sleek 'Middle Of Nowhere', Orbital made techno palatable to music fans otherwise ignorant of the club scene, whilst still maintaining their credibility and desire to experiment. They'll always have a place in the heart of electronica heads the world over, if only for their trademark head-mounted flashlights that made them look like moles."

It's a line oft repeated, but without Pixies many of today's guitar bands wouldn't have realised the lengths to which rock music, both lyrically and dynamically, could be pushed.

An appearance at John Peel's Meldown Festival in London raised their profile and their debut album 'For Beginner Piano' arrived in 1999, which saw them experiment further with Kraftwerkian sounds and the sort of jingles that the BBC Radiophonic Workshop used to record to play behind the test card.

As the 80s ended, PWEI leaned towards more hardcore dance, with 1989's 'This Is The Hour, This Is The Day, This Is This!' album being their most effective outing. The Poppies notched up several UK hits, including 'Can U Dig It?' and 'Wise Up Sucker', but the band ran out of steam in 1995 with bassist Richard March enjoying some success in Bentley Rhythm Ace.

A bassist, top session man and former member of post-house band The Grid, Gifford wanted to record his own material and enlisted Will White on drums and decks to tap into the new big beat sound that was pounding the nation's dancefloors at the time. Luckily for them, their first single 'Dive' (1996) was soon picked up for an Adidas ad and similar club success followed with the 'Take California' and 'Spybreak!' EPs. The band achieved a genuine crossover with their cover of the 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme' (recorded for a James Bond tribute compilation), leading to The Propellerheads contributing material to the Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies. 1998's 'Decksanddrumsandrockandroll' and the Shirley Bassey-powered single 'History Repeating' were both successful, but the band have stuck mainly to production work since then."

The pair first got together in the obscure but magnificently-named Motorgoat, releasing a solitary single in 1993. They didn't follow it up until 1996's 'Early Recordings' album, after which Weiss joined Sleater Kinney for a period and Coobes busied himself working with Built To Spill and Elliot Smith's band. The first real Quasi album arrived in 1996 as 'R&B Transmogrification' and subsequent works include 'Featuring Birds' (1998), Field Studies (1999) and The Sword Of God (2001), by which time they had moved to noted US indie label Touch And Go. Their most recent work to date is the wryly-humorous 'Hot Sh*t!' from 2003, a bitingly political but witty response to post 9/11 hysteria."

Updating the classic Detroit sound, Hawtin's best early work is probably his 1993 debut 'Dimension Intrusion' which mixes the harder club sounds with chill-out material more suited to 'home listening', as he calls it. The same year also saw the debut of Plastikman with the 'Spastik' single, a track that showcased Hawtin's love of the Roland 303 'acid' sound. After numerous releases under the F.U.S.E. and Plastikman names, Hawtin finally relased an album under his own name in 1999, 'Decks, EFX & 909', and continues to issue albums on the Mute offshoot Novamute."

The subsequent album 'Rock Bottom' (1974) is a brutally honest chronicle of his accident, but Wyatt moved on and landed of the most unexpected hits of 1974 with a cover of The Monkees' 'I'm A Believer'. Top Of The Pops refused to let Wyatt perform onstage in his wheelchair, but after a public outcry, they relented. Wyatt was quiet for the rest of the decade, but reappeared in the 80s when artists such as Elvis Costello started namechecking him - Costello paid tribute with an emotional rendition of Wyatt's politically-charged 'Shipbuilding', a damning indictment of the Falklands war."

In 1975 formed the shortlived Trigger with guitarist Chris Spedding and Bill Bruford of Yes, but Harper went solo again for 1977's star-studded 'Bullinamingvase'.

Stylistically similar to Brit supergroup Elastica, Wener's breathy vocals were bolstered by some sturdy punk playing from Jon Stewart (guitar), Diid Osman (bass) and Andy MacLure (drums). Their 1993 debut single 'Alice In Vain' garnered good reviews, and they topped the indie charts the following year with 'Delicious'. A support slot on Blur's Parklife tour raised their profile enough to send their debut album 'Smart' into the UK charts at number five, but despite Wener being a photogenic 'face' in the music papers, 1996's follow-up 'The It Girl' failed to do business and the band called it quits shortly afterwards. Wener now earns a living as a successful author - her books include 'Goodnight Steve McQueen' and 'The Perfect Play'."

The music became more expansive on 'Wild Love' (1995) and 'The Doctor Came At Dawn' (1996), but a slight name change to (Smog) indicated that Callahan was ready to return to more introverted work for 2001's 'Rain On Lens' (2001).

But let's not hold that against them. Formed by Robert Wyatt (vocals, drums) and Kevin Ayers (bass), the duo enlisted keyboard player Mike Ratledge and Aussie guitarist Daevid Allen to form Soft Machine. With Allen encountering visa problems, the remaining trio issued their eponymous debut LP in 1968, but Ayers left shortly afterwards, to be replaced by Hugh Hopper for 1969's 'Volume 2'. 'Third' (1970) added a horn section to the group, but as 'Fourth' (1971) delved deeper in the world of jazz fusion, a frustrated Wyatt left to pursue a solo career. With the departure of Ratledge in 1976, the band was effectively over, although other line-ups continued to use the name into the 80s."

The Hitmeister' was her debut album for Matador in 1998 and was comprised of snippets from all the records in her shop that she couldn't sell. In a change of tack, 1999's 'Pick Up' was painstakingly constructed from dozens of recordings that she'd secretly made at live shows in Amsterdam. This extraordinary technique was continued on the albums 'Low Kick And Hard Bop' (2001) and 'The Laughing Stock of Indie Rock' (2004) which showcased Esselink's wry sense of humour. Her latest album is 2005's 'In The Fishtank', 2005. Oh, and Solex is a Hungarian moped if you're interested.<BR/><blockquote>\"My favorite session was a live show in the studio (2000). We played twosets on air in front of a live audience. Peel, who did the show from thesame room, said the audience should get closer to the band and not make itthat obvious they were only there for the free beers and snacks.When he aired our final session in 2002, I listened to the live webcast. He said some nice things and I dropped him an email right away. I joked about doing the next sessions at Peel acres. He read the email on the show and said that the Peel acres session was a very good idea. Unfortunately that session never happened.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Elisabeth Esselink (Solex)"

Where Pixies still tried to operate within the structure of rock and roll, Sonic Youth cast aside any convention. Essential releases include 1988's 'Daydream Nation' (probably their most cohesive), while 'Dirty' in 1992 remains their most pop, if such an adjective can be used in a description of Sonic Youth.

In the wake of their excellent debut single 'Gangsters', the ska-punk template and the authentic Rude Boy look became hugely fashionable, while The Specials continued to notch up hits like 'A Message To You Rudi' and the banned-by-the-BBC 'Too Much Too Young'. Despite scoring a number 1 with the politcally charged (and extremely relevant due to recent race riots) 'Ghost Town', the band lost direction and soon split when Hall took guitarist Lynval Golding and percussionist Neville Staples to form Fun Boy Three. Dammers soldiered on as The Special AKA, but despite a major hit with 'Free Nelson Mandela', he called it quits soon afterwards to concentrate on his Artists Against Apartheid work."

The duo released low-key mail-order only singles as Stereolab in 1991, but 'Peng!' was their first album proper and saw the recruitment of Mary Hansen on keyboards, ex-Microdisney man Sean O'Hagan on guitar and Andy Ramsey on drums. 1993's 'Transient Random Noise Bursts With Announcements' tapped into the vogue for easy listening grooves and comfortably appealed to both dance and indie fans, giving the group a fashionable aura that led Sadier to sing on Blur's 'To The End' single. Maintaining a fiercely devoted fanbase, Stereolab continued to release critically acclaimed material, including 'Mars Audiac Quintet' (1994) and 'Emperor Tomato Ketchup' (1996). Despite the death of original member Hansen in a road accident in 2002, the band carried on with 2004's 'Margerine Eclipse'."

The band signed to Ankst in 1993 for two Welsh language EPs, before joining Creation in '95. The album 'Fuzzy Logic' was an instant classic, spawning the hits 'God! Show Me Magic' and 'Hometown Unicorn', while the band used the work of artist Pete Fowler as the springboard for some impressive live shows. After two more albums in the same vein, 2000's 'Mwng' saw them return to their Welsh roots and 2001's 'Rings Around The World' boasted guest appearances from Paul McCartney and John Cale. Their last two albums - 'Phantom Power' (2003) and 'Love Kraft' (2005) - have seen the band become ever more eclectic, while they still hold the record for the most swearwords on one single (1996's 'The Man Don't Give A F**k').<BR/><blockquote>\"I was in Studio 5, working with Leo Sayer, and SFA were next door in Studio 4. I remember these clouds of funny-smelling smoke coming out of the doors of their studio, and when they saw Leo they basically dragged him in to join them. I'll never forget the look on Leo Sayer's face after he came back in to Studio 5 after being accosted by a bunch of mad Welsh blokes. I can't imagine what they spoke about.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Simon Askew"

Under the pseudonym Marc Bolan, he became the darling of the underground press with his folk duo Tyrannosaurus Rex. With Steve Peregrine Took on bongos, Bolan released three albums of fairy-filled whimsy, but in 1970 Took was replaced by Mickey Finn, Bolan shortened the name to T-Rex, issued the fuzz-rock pop of 'Ride A White Swan' and found himself at number two in the charts. Bolan was now a teen pin-up with chart toppers like 'Hot Love' and 'Get It On', but after an impressive run of hits, the kids had moved on by 1975 and punk seemed to signal the end of T-Rex. In September 1977, Bolan was killed in a car crash on Barnes Common in London - now a shrine to the 'Bopping Elf'."

With Francis McDonald on drums (later replaced by Brendan O'Hare), the 'Fannies' released 'A Catholic Education' on Creation in 1990, a clear-cut gem in the midst of the muddy grunge and dull shoegazing that was prevalent at the time. Wilfully perverse, but always with an eye on classic guitar pop, the band could flit from the glory of the 'God Knows It's True EP', to the deliberately obscure instrumental album 'The King'. They signed to Geffen the same time as Nirvana did, with 'Bandwagonesque' marking a career high and topping a number of end of year lists. Despite frequent label changes, the Fannies continue to release well-received albums, the latest being 2005's 'Man Made'."

1895,"The Damned","damned.jpg","The Damned are the band that broke punk in the UK. Their single 'New Rose', released in October 1976, is considered to be the very first British punk track. The b-side was a thrashed out cover of The Beatles 'Help'. <BR/>The band had only formed a few months previously, when Captain Sensible (real name Raymond Burns), Rat Scabies (Chris Millar), Brian James (Brian Robertson) and Dave Vanian (David Letts) were drawn together by the emerging new music scene. They were dismissed as the support act for the Sex Pistols' Anarchy tour, but made up for it by being the first UK punk band to tour the US. <BR/>The Damned weren't as angsty as many of their contemporaries, they had a love of the theatrical that meant they were not taken as seriously. After their second album 'Music for Pleasure' they were dropped from their record label Stiff. They split in 1978, but Sensible, Vanian and Scabies reformed a year later to make the album 'Machine Gun Etiquette.' Captain Sensible is probably the most famous member, known primarily for the track 'Happy Talk' which went to No.1 in the early 80s. <BR/><blockquote>\"I think I was apprehensive about it, because I hadn't seen them before or met them; but, in fact, when we got to the studio, I'm not sure who was more apprehensive, them, about being in a BBC studio, or me about working with them. <BR/>\"The amusing thing was quite a few other people had heard that the Damned were in, and every now and again we got people creeping in through the door, looking in through the window to see if they were being sick all over the place or spitting at us. Which they weren't at all, of course; they were four of the nicest blokes I ever got to work with.\" </blockquote><BR/>- Jeff Griffin (In Session Tonight by Ken Garner)"
1896,"The Delgados","Delgados.jpg","This group, named after Spanish cyclist Pedro Delgado, have played an important role in the Scottish music scene, launching several careers, including Bis and Arab Strap, through their label Chemikal Underground. <BR/>As musicians they typified the lo-fi Scottish indie sound, particularly on their first album 'Domestiques', which prompted Peel to call them 'the best in Britain, whilst their 1998 single 'Pull The Wires From The Wall' went to the top of that year's Festive Fifty. They later moved into more orchestral rock, working with former Flaming Lips producer Dave Friddman for the albums 'The Great Eastern' and 'Hate'. Their most recent release was 2004's 'Universal Audio'."

At first listen, their debut album 'Psychocandy' (1985) could be seen to be nothing but white noise and squalling feedback, but peer a little deeper and you'll see loveable, simple pop songs peeking back out at you from underneath the wreckage. Their unique sound had a huge impact on both UK and US music, inspiring everyone from My Bloody Valentine to Dinosaur Jnr. The band was centred around two Scottish brothers, William and Jim Reid, along with a cast of supporting characters - most notably Bobby Gillespie on drums, who went on to form Primal Scream. Subsequent albums included 'Darklands' (1987), 'Automatic' (1989) 'Honey's Dead' (1992) and 'Munki' (released on Sub Pop records in 1998). They disbanded in 1999, releasing their Peel sessions in 2000."

Purveyors of cerebral, abstract and quite lush electronica nearly a decade before Air got around to releasing 'Moon Safari', The Orb virtually invented ambient house. But they escaped dinner party hell by way of an eye for the curious, esoteric end of sampling. The first Orb record, 1991's 'Adventures Beyond The Ultraworld' featured the sound of seagulls and astronauts, manna for spaced-out and exhausted disco kids. However, label problems after the release of harder second album 'UF.Orb' meant The Orb were out of action longer than they probably wanted to be. No matter, because already their place alongside the likes of Aphex Twin and their idol Brian Eno was assured."

2043,"The Smiths","smiths.jpg","Formed in Manchester in 1982 around the songwriting duo of Morrissey and Johnny Marr, the shadow of The Smiths loomed large over the independent scene in the 80s. Morrissey's enigmatic persona, with his self-confessed celibacy, militant vegetarianism and obsession with forgotten 1960s movie stars, launched a thousand clones. Johnny Marr's effortless knack for a melody melded perfectly with his partner's grimly witty observations on life and death. Supported by bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce, The Smiths reeled off countless hits like 'This Charming Man', 'Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now', 'Panic' and 'Ask'. The band flourished with landmark Peel sessions that were, for many, their first introduction to The Smiths and were compiled on the superb 'Hatful Of Hollow' album. The band were about to sign to EMI after four excellent albums, but suddenly split in 1987 amid much acrimony. With Morrissey's current 'superstar' solo career, a reunion currently seems unlikely.<BR/><blockquote>\"When we first got the call do to our initial session we were in our manager's office in Manchester, which was a clothing manufacturing warehouse where we rehearsed. Joe, our manager, told us we'd got a Peel session and we were ecstatic and then we immediately panicked because we'd not really had any experience of being in a studio.<BR/>\"On the day of the session we set off from Manchester, all of us in a little van, at about 7am, so by the time we got to London we were pretty exhausted. As an eighteen year old I felt so intimidated walking into the BBC. <BR/>\"Those sessions taught me how to make records. We had to do it very quickly, so we had to be really together and know what we were doing. We worked very hard, and it was worth it.<BR/>\"Shortly afterwards, after our first album came out, we realised that some of the versions of the songs on the album weren't as good as the way we did them on the John Peel session. Because of this we put out a compilation called 'Hatful Of Hollow', which featured those John Peel sessions, and as a result they pretty much became the definitive versions of the songs we recorded for John. <BR/>\"What happened to us was that whenever a session came up, we wrote songs, because we needed them, especially for the session. 'This Charming Man', for example, was written because we had a John Peel session and we didn't have enough songs. The session was on a Friday, and on the Tuesday I just got out of bed and wrote this tune because we needed another song for the session.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Johnny Marr, The Smiths"

2080,"To Rococo Rot","to-roccoco-rot.jpg","A Berlin post-rock trio featuring Stefan Schneider (bass), Robert Lippok (guitar, keys) and his brother Ronald (drums,) To Rococo Rot are keen on mixing art school experimentalism with classic pop sensibilities. After their untitled picture disc debut in 1995 (issued as part of an art project), the band expanded on the material to produce their debut album '.CD' the same year. A collection of mechanical ticks and mesmerising loops, the record attracted the attention of City Slang, who signed them in 1997 for the album 'Veiculo'. More traditional grooves and samples appeared on 1999's 'The Amateur View', but the band rejected both the 'dance' and the 'post-rock' tags, preferring to remain uncategorised. Subsequent releases include 'Music Is A Hungry Ghost' (2001) and 'Hotel Morgen' (2004). In 1999, To Rococo Rot recorded a soundtrack to a documentary on rocket fuel narrated by William Shatner, which later appeared on 2001's 'Cars EP'. No, really!"

Topper's 'Arch Noa EP' was released in 1997, and was swiftly followed by the mildly-acclaimed mini album 'Something To Tell Her' and another, single 'Cwpan Mewn Dwr'. An appearance with their peers Big Leaves, Derrero and Melys on the 1999 Fierce Panda compilation 'Dial M For Merthyr' gave them some exposure, but the band were last heard of the 'Dolur Gwddw' album in October 2000."

Both were proudly Welsh language releases and were followed in 1997 by the full length 'Rhaid I Rhywbeth Ddigwydd (Something's Got To Happen)', which chronicled Cardiff life in painful detail with such lyrical concerns as 'going to the Spar to buy Wagon Wheels'. Welsh label Ankstmusik liked the album and reissued some of the tracks as the 'The Brewer Spinks EP', while 1999's more ambitious 'Shrug Off Ya Complex' had over 20 different musicians contributing. Cravos's passion for political material didn't sit well with Meredith, who left shortly afterwards and 2000's 'Hen Gelwydd Prydain Newydd' was an all-out anti-New Labour diatribe. After one more album, Cravos split the band in 2002."

2146,"Undertones","undertones.jpg","The ultimate John Peel band. The Undertones' 1978 ode to masturbation, 'Teenage Kicks', was named as the great man's favourite ever track. But the Londonderry quintet - based around the wavering voice of the permanently anoraked Feargal Sharkey and the O'Neill brothers - almost packed it in until a local record shop owner financed the punk-pop 'Teenage Kicks EP'. Immediately championed by Peel ('I still play Teenage Kicks to remind myself how a great record should sound,' he later said), the band bagged a deal with Sire, who issued the equally essential adolescent odes 'My Perfect Cousin' and 'Jimmy Jimmy'. Subsequent, more mature-sounding albums didn't do as well and The Undertones split after 'The Sin Of Pride' appeared in 1983. Sharkey embarked on a brief solo career, before becoming a high-powered A&R man, while the O'Neills formed That Petrol Emotion and have occasionally revived The Undertones minus their original singer.<BR/><blockquote>\"We were a bunch of late teenagers having a good time. By January 1979 we were over supporting the Rezillos so we could do a session at Maida Vale. But the biggest thing that struck me at the time was that John Peel had paid for us to do that first tape the previous autumn out of his own pocket. I don't know of any other DJ that I've met who would care to that extent, show that much drive and commitment to the music.\"</blockquote><BR/>- Feargal Sharkey (In Session Tonight by Ken Garner)"
2147,"Underworld","underworld.jpg","Karl Hyde (vocals) and Rick Smith (guitar) first worked together in early 80s poseur band Freur. By 1988, such pretensions were a distant memory and the pair collaborated on a funk band called Underworld, releasing two albums at the turn of the decade. In post-Acid House dance boom, Smith and Hyde hooked up with DJ Darren Emerson and revamped the Underworld name for the thumping progressive guitar-fuelled techno of 'Dubnobasswithmyheadman' in 1993. Their big moment came in 1996 when the single 'Born Slippy' was used as one of the main themes to the cult smack addict movie Trainspottting; Hyde's heavily distorted mantra of 'lager lager lager' touching a nerve in the national psyche. The album 'Second Toughest In The Infants' sold well but Underworld had trouble replicating their success and Emerson departed in 2000. Born Slippy and their jaw-dropping 14-hour jam at Glastonbury in 1992 are still probably their finest moments."

The trio consisted of Graham Kemp, Fergus Lawrie and Elaine Graham. In 1994 they contributed a live recording of the song Guitars are Boring to a compilation released by the Kazoo Club (based in Glasgow's notorious 13th Note bar). This recording, along with their fanzine Kitten Frenzy brought the band to the attention of John Peel and a session followed. The band then recorded a six track maxi single All Hail Urusei Yatsura. With the proceeds of the Peel session the band released a split single on their own Modern Independent Records label, Pampered Adolescent. They were later lured to London's Che Records where they released more records, but the band split after releasing their fourth album."

2185,"Viv Stanshall","","Vivian Stanshall was an eccentric pioneer that pushed boundaries in music, comedy, poetry and art and won a legion of fans, including John Peel in the process. <BR/>  In the mid-1960s he led the group Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, who caused a stir on the college rock circuit and had a Top 10 hit in 1968 with 'I'm the Urban Spaceman'. The Bozo band split in 1970.  With the encouragement of John Peel, Vivian developed the idea of the eccentric English aristocrat Sir Henry Rawlinson, who was later to achieve a full flowering in the 1980 film, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End. Sir Henry's philosophy was, \"If I had all the money I'd spent on drink I'd spend it all on drink.\" <BR/> When Peel went on holidays he asked Vivian to stand in for him. Vivian launched his alter-ego character, Sir Henry on Peel's Top Gear show and it was so successful with listeners that he was asked to continue the skit when Peel returned from holidays. <BR/> <blockquote>John said of Vivian: \"I could never really think of anything to say when I'd played one of his pieces on the radio, and would end up, rather feebly, with something along the lines of 'I fear that a single one of Viv's thoughts would blow my damn brains out.'\"</blockquote>"

2191,"Wah!","wah.jpg","Wah! was just one of the obscure titles, along with Wah! Heat, The Mighty Wah!,  Shambeko! Say Wah! and The Mongrel, under which Pete Wylie has exercised his obsessions. One of Liverpool's 'Crucial Three' (along with Julian Cope and Ian McCulloch), Wylie launched his band as Wah! Heat in 1979, but the line-up remained fluid from record to record with styles varying wildly from no-nonsense rock to reggae. After a string of unsuccessful singles to his name, Wylie finally broke through with 1982's blue-eyed soul pastiche 'The Story Of The Blues', which hit number three in the charts. Unable to follow-up the success, Wylie thankfully ditched the increasingly silly Wah! names and returned with 1987's top ten hit 'Sinful'. Hanging out with The Farm in the early 90s did little to revive his fortunes, and a serious fall in 1991 put Wylie's musical career on hold. The Mighty Wah! returned for 2000's unremarkable 'Songs Of Strength And Heartbreak'."

I first heard the White Stripes when we went to an event in Groningen in the Netherlands called Noorderslag and Eurosonic, and there's a wonderful record shop, very small, not much bigger than this studio, it's just a great record shop, and I went in there and the first White Stripes LP was in there as an import from the States. And I just liked the look of it and I looked at the titles - you develop an instinct, d'you know what I mean? And it looked like the sort of record I would like, so I took it out and I did like it, and started playing it. Now I get a lot of music from Detroit. The fact that it's successful is good.\"</blockquote>"
